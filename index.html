<h2 id="campaign">Campaign</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4106197-tormentor.jpg" alt="Tormentors"></p>
<p>The campaign has the same structure as The Witch Queen, where there are only 8 missions with no open world content in between other than occasionally talking to NPCs or finding the mission start area, which is great. The missions themselves are very reminiscent of Halo 3: ODST, and most are pretty memorable, such as the big fight with the Shadow Legion inside the pyramid or the Rocky-like strand training montage. I would say they are slight improvements from The Witch Queen missions, which were already great, so no complaints on the missions themselves, although I feel the new co-op scaling made the legendary difficulty far too easy. Where my friends and I struggled on many missions, especially the final boss of the Witch Queen, I’ve found that we only wiped in maybe 2 or 3 encounters in Lightfall. The new enemies in this expansion are the Tormentors, who seem very reminiscent of Rhulk from Vow of the Disciple. While they look menacing, it doesn’t seem to translate over to gameplay. Their attacks are extremely telegraphed, and it is very easy to kite them around and take no damage. Worst of all, they are affected by Stasis freeze, disorienting grenades, and Strand suspension, so doing any of those takes any threat away from them. I would say the Hive Lightbearers from the Witch Queen are designed much better, as well as having more variety with their 3 variants. On the other hand, I still feel like Tormentors were good additions, as they could fit into almost any content, unlike the Hive Lightbearers, so it will be exciting to see them in the future. Another mechanic added were darkness shard backpacks, which were added to some Shadow Legion cabals. I didn’t find they added much; at best, they were an annoyance because you had to shoot another object to properly damage enemies, and at worst, you could just ignore them and move on. Overall, I feel like the campaign’s gameplay was the best part of it, and most would enjoy it a lot even if it’s a bit short. My biggest complaint was regarding the difficulty, but I can see why Bungie did it. Looking online, you can hear many people struggling with the campaign, both solo and co-op, so maybe more casual players will feel the proper difficulty they intended.</p>
<h2 id="neomuna">Neomuna</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/2023/02/15/b5cddcf8/lightfall_neomuna_compressed_2.jpg" alt="Neomuna Image"></p>
<p>Neomuna is yet another empty patrol area. It was once thought to be another city where people lived far away from the lightbearers. However, this time around, I think Neomuna is one of the least inspired and boring locations in Destiny so far. It’s clear Bungie wanted to follow the cyberpunk aesthetic that’s been popular for a while now, but it just feels so opposed to Destiny as a franchise. Places we usually visit are destroyed, empty, or occupied by enemy forces, which made it easy to understand why there were no civilians around. But now we are supposed to believe that we are in a city where everyone is uploaded to the “CloudArk” and that two Cloudstriders can hold an entire city down from the Darkness-wielding Shadow Legion? Neomuna feels more empty than ever, with barely any enemies spawning and the civilians being “lightbulb”-like holograms standing around. Add on the fact that it looks surgically clean, and it looks more like a bunch of cyberpunk assets thrown together rather than an actual lived-in city. I think what would have helped was increasing the enemy density to be much higher than it is right now as well as destroying parts of Neomuna, similar to Scourge of the Past’s Last City environment, so it feels like an actual warzone and you can understand why the Neomunans went into hiding in virtual reality, because as it stands right now, there’s not a whole lot of reason to feel connected to this area at all outside of the initially neat change of atmosphere. Another issue with the Neomuna patrol area itself is the level of the enemies inside. I haven’t been underleveled for enemies in a patrol area since Destiny 1, and it is very annoying to get one shot by threshers trying to get to missions because the enemies are always leveled higher than you, even after completing the legendary campaign. It gets extremely evident when you try to do the lost sectors, which are unique and cool, until you realize all the enemies and bosses are super bullet-spongy and kill you really fast for just being a patrol lost sector. I can’t imagine how boring the Neomuna lost sectors would be on higher difficulties.</p>
<h2 id="story-spoilers-beyond">Story [Spoilers Beyond]</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.stashmedia.tv/wp-content/uploads/Bungie-Destiny-2-Lightfall-Trailer-The-Mill6.jpg" alt="Unseen Story Moment"></p>
<p>If you have been around the Destiny community at all recently, you have definitely heard about how disappointing the story and writing were in this expansion, and it’s hard to disagree. While I don’t have much to add that wasn’t already said, the new characters they added were terribly underdeveloped, and Nimbus isn’t very likeable, no matter how cool Bungie tries to make them look. It has been a long time since I’ve played a game and knew word-for-word what would happen next; there are no twists in this campaign; rather, the mystery is in the objects everyone else but you seems to know about— the “Veil” and “Radial Mast” — I’m still not too sure what either of these things are by the end of the story, and it’s a big shame that Bungie addresses the lack of explanation by saying that it will be explained in the upcoming seasons, which will be deleted come The Final Shape. Another issue you can tell immediately after finishing it is how cobbled together this expansion’s story was. The first and last cutscenes of the expansion are the only relevant parts of the story, and it’s obvious they were just cuts of a longer cutscene for the actual intro of the expansion. My theory is that we were supposed to have Strand in The Witch Queen through Deepsight, and the beginning of Lightfall was supposed to start with the cutscene spliced together and we would adventure into the traveler. There is no reason for Neomuna to exist if Bungie didn’t write in that “The Veil” is deep under Neomuna, which has never been referenced before and neither needs to be. This all comes together when you realize Lightfall was supposed to be the end of the Light and Dark Saga, until they announced on the road to The Witch Queen that they would need to make another expansion called The Final Shape to fully complete the saga. This shows that Lightfall was meant to be filler ever since they realized that they didn’t have the time needed to end it on Lightfall, which explains the odd tonal shift from the Traveler being blocked by the pyramids to signify the end of the war to the 80’s movie aesthetic with Neomuna that we actually received. We will most likely get a full explanation for this story and the real ending to Lightfall with The Final Shape. Hopefully Bungie can recover from what they did with Neomuna, or just fully abandon it and forget it existed.</p>
<h2 id="strand">Strand</h2>
<p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltef7d3aa1243da851/63e18237295f164f53ab3b87/16_9.jpg" alt="Strand"></p>
<p>I have only tried Warlock’s strand subclass, Broodweaver, so I do not personally know how the other subclasses play, but the Warlock one is incredibly strong and fun. The gameplay loop seems to revolve around creating and using hatchlings, which are “sentient” worm-like creatures that seek out enemies. In reality, they are more like ground heat-seeking missiles, but if they do not detect any enemies, they return to you and fire again when they see enemies. Almost every ability you have creates threadlings that do very potent damage; your melee has three charges, but outside of the campaign, they recharge very slowly and don’t seem to be that strong without having the three charges, which is disappointing. I feel as if the melee should recharge all three when a cooldown is done. The super, “Needlestorm,” is very reminiscent of the Shatter Nova Bomb from Destiny 1, where it’s a one-and-done super that targets a wide area and explodes everything; this time, though, there are much more explosions, and all of them create threadlings that do a lot of damage, which is very satisfying to see. Not only does Needlestorm do comparable damage to Nova Bomb, but it also clears much more enemies than Nova Bomb does, which means it’s a viable super, which is greatly appreciated. A problem I had with Strand is the cooldowns. During the campaign, your grapple charges in about 5 seconds when you hit the ground, which felt overtuned, but once you acquire Strand for yourself, you find the grapple grenade taking about as long to charge as the other grenades, which means you can grapple about once every minute, which feels extremely slow and not worth it since the grapple melee attack is way too risky for the amount of damage it does. The grapple cooldown needs to be buffed to at least every 40 seconds with tier 10 discipline to be worth using on anything above patrol content. Another issue I had with the campaign was that they drip-fed the aspects and fragments to you during the campaign but forced you to use strand, which means you’re forced to use a weaker subclass during the mission, which is an odd choice. The Strand you use in the campaign should be the strongest version of it to showcase its power.</p>
<h2 id="post-game">Post-Game</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.theloadout.com/wp-content/sites/theloadout/2023/01/destiny-2-lightfall-improvements.jpg" alt="Unlock Strand"></p>
<p>The post-game is pretty standard Destiny 2 far; once you unlock Strand, getting kills with Strand Abilities gives you a currency called Strand Meditations which allow you to unlock new Grenades, Aspects, and Fragments. This is much improved from the incredibly grindy Stasis unlock system from Beyond Light, but a weird change they made is that Fragments are not account-wide anymore, which means that if you unlock Strand on a different character, you have to redo the Strand Meditation grind even though you’re unlocking the same fragments. Other things to do are a 2-part filler quest where you find region chests and do patrols or public events. What I am looking forward to are the 2 exotic weapon quests, which will hopefully explain some questions story-wise and be some fun weapons to chase. One of the quests you unlock by acquiring all Strand abilities, while the other you acquire by completing the Lightfall campaign. Overall, the post-game content is pretty standard from what I’ve seen, which is fine.</p>
<h2 id="armor-mod-system">Armor Mod System</h2>
<p><img src="https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/article/2023/02/27/destiny-2-lightfall-campaign-walkthrough_feature.jpg" alt="Lightfall  Armor"></p>
<p>It’s hard to be excited for the new mod system when it oversimplifies things beyond belief, once a deep and layered armored mod system has turned into cookie cutter builds. Charged with Light and well mods are fully replaced with an armor charge system, where the only reliable way to gain armor charges is to create orbs of power. The problem with this fact is that orbs do not have a seeking mod, which means you have to go out of your way to pick them up, which can be very annoying if you are trying to stay in cover or the orb goes out of bounds. Another issue is that a lot of unique mods were removed, like Surprise Attack and the entire Warmind Cell system, which means that you’re basically forced into making a grenade energy build, melee energy build, or hybrid with some matching elemental weapons generating orbs. Another issue is the total lack of interaction with Stasis. While Light subclasses got new buffs such as Void Breaches, which allow them to get ability energy and armor charges by picking them up, Stasis gets nothing, and there are no mods that interact with Stasis shards, which messes up a lot of builds. I get why Bungie was trying to make mods more new-player friendly and necessary to play the game. I feel like it just removed some depth from the game while not really helping new players, as they will still continue to ignore the difficulty system unless they are forced to equip it, i.e., Champion mods.</p>
<h2 id="other-additions">Other Additions</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.ggrecon.com/media/3yhfdw0m/destiny-2-guardian-ranks-explained-ui.jpg" alt="Guardian Ranks"></p>
<p>Some other features were added with the launch of Lightfall, such as Guardian Ranks and the Commendation System. Both of these systems seem like failures and a waste of time already. They changed displaying the Seasonal Ranks of guardians in-game on your HUD to their Guardian Ranks, so you can see the cracks in the system already when you go to the tower and realize that literally everyone is level 6 like you. What was intended was that the Guardian Rank system was supposed to tell you how experienced a player was at the game, but right now it tells you literally nothing except that the player has completed the tutorial, which is all you need to do to make it to level 6. To make it past level 6, you have to do a bunch of challenges, which would be fine except anything past level 6 resets every season. Why? What makes this system literally any different from the seasonal challenges and rank system? Since these are quite literally seasonal challenges that reset every season, what reason would a player have to go past the challenge that gives the last 4 loadout slots, except to increase a number that only others can see for 1 season? This feels like a weird amalgamation of the seasonal rank system as well as titles, except they don’t seem to understand the appeal of either of them. The commendation system also feels ruined already when you tie commendation scores to Guardian Ranks and a Hawthorne powerful engram challenge, so now people are incentivized to commend people for an engram instead of being a notable player at all. I feel like you should be limited to commending people a few times a day with no in-game reward, so that when a player gets commended they feel like something important happened and vice versa.</p>

</ul>
<p><em><strong>Overall Rating - 7/10</strong></em></p>
<p>The disappointment is understandable from the Destiny community, as the story for this expansion should have been much better, especially with the hype for the expansion, as well as being the second-to-last expansion in the Light and Dark saga. The characters keep talking about “The Veil” like they know what it is, but it is never explained to you what it is. Neomuna is also totally irrelevant to the rest of the game’s story, as the only reason we go to Neomuna is to find “The Veil”, and if Bungie decided to put “The Veil” anywhere else, we would never bother going to Neomuna. It’s very obvious that strand was meant for The Witch Queen, and Lightfall was supposed to have a much different tone and maybe not have Neomuna at all. This theory is even more clear when you find that Neomuna and its cloudstriders are rushed and just underdeveloped, while not having civilians in the game is understandable, Neomuna should have looked like it was at war against the Shadow Legion and Vex, but a lot of parts are empty and surgically clean, when it should have looked more like a war zone. Outside the story and writing, the campaign’s gameplay is great, and I would easily recommend it if you don’t care about Destiny’s ongoing narrative. It is very far from the worst expansion, but players are right to have expected more from this expansion.</p>
